In contrast to competing products that frequently call for manual setup and the fusion of several separate solutions, Dynatrace provides a smooth, all-in-one platform driven by cutting-edge AI-driven analytics. This integration enables accurate anomaly detection, real-time topology mapping, and automated monitoring over the whole technological stack, including hybrid and multicloud systems. \n\nThe platform's AI engine, Davis, provides actionable insights by automatically identifying and prioritizing performance issues, which significantly reduces the time and effort required for troubleshooting and ensures optimal application performance and security. \nAdditionally, Dynatrace's Digital Experience Management (DEM) ensures that every user interaction is monitored, providing a holistic view of user experiences and business impacts without data sampling, thus offering more reliable and comprehensive insights compared to competitors like Datadog and AppDynamics.\n\nUnique Value Proposition:\nDynatrace offers end-to-end observability across dynamic cloud environments, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This is achieved through automatic discovery and mapping of all components within the IT ecosystem, ensuring comprehensive visibility into performance metrics, logs, traces, and user behavior data. The platform's ability to provide this level of observability out-of-the-box, without requiring additional configuration, sets it apart from competitors like Datadog, which often necessitate manual tagging and the deployment of multiple agents for different environments.\n\nProduct Categories: 64e5ebea4558409aac797250\nParent Categories: 64e5e7db6295fca3e00f3251\n\nProduct Capabilities and Features:\nFeature Richness Level: Rich\n\nCore Features:\n1. 66bb0fbb58c8e12709006fb8\n2. 66bb0fbb58c8e12709006fb9\n3. 66bb0fbb58c8e12709006fba\n4. 66bb0fbb58c8e12709006fbb\n\nAdditional Capabilities:\n- Dashboard, Baseline Manager, Server Monitoring, Application Management, Alerts/Notifications\n- Automated Discovery, Automatic Test Generation, Application-Level Analysis, Administrator Level Control, Full-Stack Monitoring \n- Real User Monitoring (RUM) , Synthetic Monitoring, Infrastructure Monitoring , Application Performance Monitoring (APM) , Cloud Infrastructure Monitoring\n\nPlatform Support: 66bb0fa658c8e12709006fb2, 66bb0fa658c8e12709006fb3, 66bb0fa658c8e12709006fb4, 66bb0fa658c8e12709006fb5, 66bb0fa658c8e12709006fb6\n\nPricing and Business Model:\nPrice Range: Paid\n- Available Plans: 6 pricing tiers\n  Plan 1: Full-stack Monitoring - USD 0.08/Month\n  Plan 2: Infastructure Monitoring - USD 0.04/Month\n  Plan 3: Kubernetes Monitoring - USD 0.002/Month\n\nCustomer Satisfaction and Reviews:\nOverall Rating Tier: Excellent\nTotal Customer Reviews: 1341\nOverall Rating: 4.60/5.0 stars\nDetailed Ratings Breakdown:\n- Ease of Use: 4.30/5.0\n- Feature Breadth: 3.50/5.0\n- Implementation Ease: 3.50/5.0\n- Value for Money: 4.05/5.0\n- Customer Support: 4.00/5.0\n\nTechnical Specifications and Integrations:\nAvailable Integrations (7):\n- Slack (integrates with https://slack.com)\n- Targetprocess (integrates with https://www.targetprocess.com/)\n- OpendevOP (integrates with https://www.atlassian.com/blog/devops/open-devops)\n- Pagerduty (integrates with https://www.pagerduty.com)\n- azure portal (integrates with https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/azure-portal)\n- Bitbucket (integrates with https://www.bitbucket.org/product)\n- Jira (integrates with http://www.atlassian.com)\n\nTechnology Stack: 66b09d6c1687f9465f9b765c, 66b09d6c1687f9465f9b7660, 66b09d6c1687f9465f9b7662, 66b09d6c1687f9465f9b766d\nSupported Languages: 66c5a446c6c6f0649cefdec8\n\nMarket Position and Context:\nMarket Positioning: Established\n- Established Solution: 19 years of market presence\n- Strong Customer Base: Extensive user feedback available\n- Well-Featured Product: Solid capability foundation\n\nBusiness Relationships and Ecosystem:\nThe product Dynatrace is developed and maintained by Dynatrace.
