# Post-Ingestion RAG Usage Guide

After successfully ingesting your product database using the Product Ingestion Service, you can leverage powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities for both RFP generation and semantic search.

## üéØ Available Query Endpoints

### General Query Endpoints
- **`/query`** - Standard query with full response generation
- **`/query/stream`** - Streaming query for real-time responses  
- **`/query/data`** - Raw data retrieval (entities, relationships, chunks)

### Query Modes for Different Use Cases

#### For RFP Generation:
- **`"hybrid"`** - Combines local entities + global relationships (perfect for RFPs)
- **`"mix"`** - Integrates knowledge graph + vector retrieval (comprehensive)
- **`"global"`** - Focuses on relationships between entities

#### For Semantic Search:
- **`"local"`** - Entity-focused semantic similarity search
- **`"naive"`** - Pure vector similarity search

## üöÄ What Happens After Ingesting 8,000 Products

Once you ingest your 8,000 products, the system creates a comprehensive knowledge graph:

```
üìä Your 8,000 products become:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üè¢ Company entities (Salesforce, Microsoft, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üì± Product entities (CRM systems, databases, etc.)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üè∑Ô∏è Category entities (SaaS, Enterprise Software, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üîó Relationships (company-makes-product, product-belongs-to-category)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ Text chunks (product descriptions, features, reviews)
```

## üìã Query Examples

### RFP Generation Queries

Use **hybrid mode** for complex business requirements:

```javascript
// Complex enterprise requirements
const rfpResponse = await queryText({
  query: "I need a CRM system for a large enterprise with 500+ users, must integrate with Salesforce and have advanced reporting",
  mode: "hybrid",  // Best for complex requirements
  response_type: "Multiple Paragraphs",
  top_k: 20
})

// Industry-specific requirements
const industryResponse = await queryText({
  query: "Find CRM solutions for financial services with compliance features and audit trails",
  mode: "hybrid",
  response_type: "Bullet Points",
  top_k: 15
})

// Technical requirements
const techResponse = await queryText({
  query: "Enterprise collaboration tools with SSO, security certifications, and API integration",
  mode: "mix",
  response_type: "Multiple Paragraphs",
  top_k: 25
})
```

### Semantic Search Queries

Use **local mode** for similarity-based searches:

```javascript
// Find similar products
const similarResponse = await queryText({
  query: "project management software similar to Asana with time tracking",
  mode: "local",  // Best for similarity search
  top_k: 10
})

// Feature-based search
const featureResponse = await queryText({
  query: "business intelligence platforms with real-time dashboards",
  mode: "local",
  top_k: 12
})

// Category exploration
const categoryResponse = await queryText({
  query: "cloud databases that support multi-region deployment and backup",
  mode: "mix",
  top_k: 15
})
```

## üîß Specialized Query Methods

Your Product Ingestion Service includes dedicated query methods:

```python
from services.product_ingestion.core.service import ProductIngestionService

# Initialize service (after ingestion is complete)
service = ProductIngestionService(config)

# RFP-optimized queries
rfp_result = await service.query_for_rfp(
    "Find enterprise software solutions for digital transformation with cloud migration support"
)

# Semantic similarity searches  
semantic_result = await service.semantic_search(
    "Products similar to Microsoft Teams for remote collaboration"
)

# Custom queries with specific modes
custom_result = await service.custom_query(
    "Compare top 5 CRM platforms for small business",
    mode="hybrid",
    top_k=5
)
```

## üìä Query Capabilities

### Knowledge Graph Queries
- **Entity relationships** - "Which companies make CRM software?"
- **Product comparisons** - "Compare Salesforce vs HubSpot features"
- **Category analysis** - "All enterprise software with integration capabilities"

### Vector Similarity Queries
- **Semantic matching** - Find products by description similarity
- **Feature matching** - Products with similar functionality  
- **Use case matching** - Solutions for similar business problems

## üí° Recommended Query Strategies

### For RFP Generation:
1. **Use `"hybrid"` mode** for complex, multi-faceted requirements
2. **Set `response_type: "Multiple Paragraphs"`** for detailed responses
3. **Use higher `top_k` values (20-50)** for comprehensive results
4. **Include specific constraints** in your query (budget, user count, compliance needs)

Example RFP Query Structure:
```javascript
{
  query: "[Business context] + [Specific requirements] + [Constraints] + [Integration needs]",
  mode: "hybrid",
  response_type: "Multiple Paragraphs", 
  top_k: 25,
  max_total_tokens: 4000
}
```

### For Semantic Search:
1. **Use `"local"` mode** for similarity-based searches
2. **Use `"mix"` mode** for combining graph + vector search
3. **Use lower `top_k` values (5-15)** for focused results
4. **Be specific about features** you're looking for

Example Semantic Search Structure:
```javascript
{
  query: "[Product type] + [Key features] + [Similar to existing product]",
  mode: "local",
  top_k: 10,
  chunk_top_k: 20
}
```

## üéØ Advanced Query Features

### Streaming Queries
For real-time responses during complex analysis:

```javascript
await queryTextStream({
  query: "Comprehensive analysis of project management tools for agile development teams",
  mode: "hybrid",
  response_type: "Multiple Paragraphs"
}, 
onChunk: (chunk) => console.log(chunk),
onError: (error) => console.error(error)
)
```

### Data-Only Queries
To get raw structured data without LLM generation:

```javascript
const rawData = await queryData({
  query: "CRM software companies",
  mode: "hybrid",
  top_k: 20
})

// Returns: { entities: [...], relationships: [...], chunks: [...], metadata: {...} }
```

### Conversation Context
For follow-up queries with context:

```javascript
const followUpResponse = await queryText({
  query: "What about their pricing models?",
  mode: "hybrid",
  conversation_history: [
    { role: "user", content: "Tell me about enterprise CRM solutions" },
    { role: "assistant", content: "Here are the top enterprise CRM solutions..." }
  ],
  history_turns: 1
})
```

## üîç Query Use Case Examples

### Enterprise Software Selection
```javascript
// Multi-criteria software evaluation
const evaluation = await queryText({
  query: `
    I need to select an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for a manufacturing company with:
    - 1000+ employees across 5 locations
    - Integration with existing inventory management
    - Real-time reporting and analytics
    - Compliance with SOX regulations
    - Budget under $500K annually
  `,
  mode: "hybrid",
  response_type: "Multiple Paragraphs",
  top_k: 30
})
```

### Competitive Analysis
```javascript
// Compare competing solutions
const comparison = await queryText({
  query: "Compare the top 3 customer support platforms: features, pricing, integration capabilities, and user reviews",
  mode: "mix",
  response_type: "Bullet Points",
  top_k: 20
})
```

### Technology Stack Recommendations
```javascript
// Complete technology stack suggestions
const stackRecommendation = await queryText({
  query: "Recommend a complete technology stack for a fintech startup: database, API management, security, monitoring, and compliance tools",
  mode: "hybrid",
  response_type: "Multiple Paragraphs",
  top_k: 40
})
```

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

### Optimize Query Performance:
1. **Use appropriate `top_k` values** - Higher values = more comprehensive but slower
2. **Leverage `chunk_top_k`** for fine-tuning text retrieval
3. **Set `max_total_tokens`** to control response length and processing time
4. **Use specific query language** - More specific queries = better results

### Token Management:
```javascript
// Efficient token usage for large queries
const optimizedQuery = await queryText({
  query: "Enterprise software recommendations",
  mode: "hybrid",
  max_entity_tokens: 1000,
  max_relation_tokens: 1000,
  max_total_tokens: 3000,
  top_k: 15
})
```
